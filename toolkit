Cyber-safety and Cyberbullying
https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:97fd85fc-04ec-418a-8d14-654876ce32dc

Why it Matters:

Our phones, tablets, and computers help us connect, learn, and have fun. But not all online interactions are positive. It is important to recognize harmful behaviors like cyberbullying & know how to stay safe and support one another.

What is cyberbullying?

Cyberbullying is when someone uses technology to harass, threaten or embarrass others. It can look like:
Sending mean or hurtful messages
Spreading rumors or posting private information online
Excluding others in group chats or online games
Creating fake accounts to impersonate or harass

Cyberbullying affects wellbeing, school engagement, and feelings of safety, even outside of school.

How to Stay Safe Online:
Protect your information
Use privacy settings on social media
Don‚Äôt share passwords, even with friends
Be careful with what you post online‚Üí screenshots last forever
Pause before you Post
Would you say it face-to-face?
Could your message be misunderstood?
Is it kind and respectful?
Block and Report
Most apps and platforms let you block people who are being inappropriate
Report harmful behavior
Talk to someone you trust
Whether you‚Äôre being targeted or you see it happening to others, you‚Äôre not alone
Trusted adults like school staff, parents, or community leaders can help

What can you do if you See Cyberbullying?
Don‚Äôt join in or laugh‚Üí silence can also look like support
Offer support privately to the person being targeted
Take screenshots if you need to show a trusted adult
Report it through the app or school system



Mindful-Moment Prompts
DIY Mindful-Moments Break Cards

What you will need
3 x 5‚Äù index cards or plain printer paper
Pens, markers, or colored pencils
Scissors (if cutting paper)
Optional: stickers, tape

Steps:
Gather cards- aim for at least 4-6 so one can live near each high-use device.
Fold into a ‚Äútent‚Äù: Make a firm horizontal crease across the center, so that it can stand like an upside down V so it is readable from either side. Best if you use cardstock or double up ordinary paper.
Label the front with a big, inviting title such as ‚ÄúPAUSE‚Äù or ‚ÄúBREATHE".
Add a 3-step prompt on the back or beneath that will help you pause, notice your feelings, and choose a mindful action.
Decorate together- as a family color or add stickers so that each card feels personal.
Snap and save (optional)- take a quick photo of the finished card, crop it, and set it as your phone or computer lock-screen-saver. That way your mindful prompt pops up even when you are away from the physical tent.
Place cards- stand a tent-fold card by each high-use device such as TV, computer, game console, phone deck) or tap flat version if space is limited.
Rotate- swap prompts weekly to keep them fresh.
